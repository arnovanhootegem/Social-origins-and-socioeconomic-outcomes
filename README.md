R scripts for paper on the Social origins and socio-economic outcomes by Arno Van Hootegem, Adrian Farner Rogne, Caroline Tveter Cros, Ole Røgeberg & Torkild Hovde Lyngstad

# My R Scripts

This repository contains a collection of R scripts that I and Torkild Hovde Lyngstad have made for the paper "Social origins and socioeconomic outcomes: A combined twin and adoption study", written by Arno Van Hootegem, Adrian Farner Rogne, Caroline Tveter Cros, Ole Røgeberg and Torkild Hovde Lyngstad. 
It identifies South Korean adoptees and children of twins based on Norwegian registry data, which are then analysed using an adoption design and Multiple-Children-of-Twin models to estimate the how much of the intergenerational transmision of socioeconomic status is social.

# Scripts

- `MCoT_analysis.R`: Conducts the Multiple-Children-of-Twin analyses
- `Adoption design.R`: Prepares the adoptees data, merges socioeconomic data and conducts the analyses for the adoption design
